        <h1>Database</h1>
        <p>In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small
            databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud
            storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data
            modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive
            data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.

            A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the
            database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core
            facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated
            applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used loosely to
            refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.

            Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they
            support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series
            of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational
            databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.</p>
        <p>Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is
            usually provided by a "database management system" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer
            software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data
            contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS
            provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and
            provides ways to manage how that information is organized.

            Because of the close relationship between them, the term "database" is often used casually to refer to both
            a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.

            Outside the world of professional information technology, the term database is often used to refer to any
            collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically
            necessitate use of a database management system.[1]
